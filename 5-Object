> Object is not-Premitive data type
> An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. 
    A property is a “key: value” pair, where key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.

/* Creating an empty object, we have to ways */

let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax

/* You can also add a new key value pair like this */
let a = {
  name: "ankit",
  roll: "23",
};
a.school = "makaut";


/* you can also delete a key value pair */
let a = {
  name: "ankit",
  roll: "23",
};
a.school = "makaut";
delete a.name;
