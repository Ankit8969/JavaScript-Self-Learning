you can also write the function in object

let obj = {
  xyz() {
    console.log("check");
  },
  name: "Ankit",
};

console.log(obj);

This in OBject

“this” in methods
It’s common that an object method needs to access the information stored in the object to do its job.

let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,

  sayHi() {
    // "this" is the "current object"
    alert(this.name);
  },
};

user.sayHi();
